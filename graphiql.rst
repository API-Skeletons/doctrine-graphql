GraphiQL and Documentation
==========================

Support for GraphiQL was added in v1.0.5 along with support for
introspection queries.

The documentation for each field is created with a DocumentationProvider.
Included with zf-doctrine-graphql is an ApigilityDocumentationProvider.
If you have need for another form of documentation provider please create
an issue on github.  The more included providers the merrier.
