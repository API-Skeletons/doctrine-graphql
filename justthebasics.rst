Just The Basics
===============

The goal of this project is to get you up and running with GraphQL and Doctrine
as easily as possible.

You will need a Doctrine object manager with entities configured with
appropriate associations throughout.  Support for ad-hoc joins between
entities is not supported but you can use the EntityDefinition event
in combination with the FilterQueryBuilder event to add a new field to
a Type with such ad-hoc support.  Your Doctrine metadata must contain all the
associations.  This requriement relates to the very basics of working in
Doctrine.

There are some `config options <config.html>`_ available but they are all optional.

The first step is to add attributes to your entities.  Attributes are a
feature of PHP 8.0 which act like annotations but are built into the language.
Attributes are stored in the namespace
``ApiSkeletons\Doctrine\GraphQL\Attribute`` and there are attributes for
``Entity``, ``Field``, and ``Association``.  Use the appropriate attribute on
each element you want to be queryable from GraphQL.

.. code-block:: php
  :linenos:

  <?php

  use ApiSkeletons\Doctrine\GraphQL\Attribute as GraphQL;

  #[GraphQL\Entity]
  class Artist
  {
      #[GraphQL\Field]
      private $id;

      #[GraphQL\Field]
      private $name;
  }

That's the minimum configuration requried.  Next, create your driver using your
entity manager

.. code-block:: php
  :linenos:

  <?php

  use ApiSkeletons\Doctrine\GraphQL\Driver;

  $driver = new Driver($entityManager);

The next step is configuring your GraphQL schema.  In this section we'll create
types for the entity, the filter for the entity, and the resolver.

.. code-block:: php
  :linenos:

  <?php

  use GraphQL\Type\Definition\ObjectType;
  use GraphQL\Type\Definition\Type;
  use GraphQL\Type\Schema;

  $schema = new Schema([
      'query' => new ObjectType([
          'name' => 'query',
          'fields' => [
              'artist' => [
                  'type' => $driver->connection($driver->type(Artist::class)),
                  'args' => [
                      'filter' => $driver->filter(Artist::class),
                      'pagination' => $driver->pagination(),
                  ],
                  'resolve' => $driver->resolve(Artist::class),
              ],
          ],
      ]),
  ]);

Now, using the schema, you can start making GraphqL queries

.. code-block:: php
  :linenos:

  <?php

  use GraphQL\GraphQL;

  $query = '{ artist { edges { node { id name } } } }';

  $result = GraphQL::executeQuery($schema, $query);

If you want to add an association you must set attributes on the target entity.
In the following example the Artist entity has a one-to-many relationship with
Performance and we want to make deeper queries from Artist to Performance.

.. code-block:: php
  :linenos:

  <?php

  use ApiSkeletons\Doctrine\GraphQL\Attribute as GraphQL;

  #[GraphQL\Entity]
  class Artist
  {
      #[GraphQL\Field]
      private $id;

      #[GraphQL\Field]
      private $name;

      #[GraphQL\Association]
      private $performances;
  }

  #[GraphQL\Entity]
  class Performance
  {
      #[GraphQL\Field]
      private $id;

      #[GraphQL\Field]
      private $venue;
  }

Using the same Schema configuration as above, with the new Performance
attributes, a query of performances is now possible:

.. code-block:: php
  :linenos:

  <?php

  use GraphQL\GraphQL;

  $query = '{ artist { edges { node { id name performances { edges { node { id venue } } } } } } }';

  $result = GraphQL::executeQuery($schema, $query);

by reference or by value, cache attribute metadata, enable custom types,
add documentation to every attribute, and more.
