This project provides a Driver to be used with
`GraphQL <https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php>`_ for PHP.

You may choose which entities, fields, and associations in your object manager
are available for querying through GraphQL.  Filtering is provided for
top-level GraphQL types (those types assigned to fields on the query object
type) and for all association collections below that type.

Pagination of collections supports
`GraphQL's Complete Connection Model <https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/#complete-connection-model>`_.

This project uses the latest advancements in the PHP language.
