This project provides a Driver to be used with
`GraphQL <https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php>`_ for PHP.

You may choose which entities, fields, and associations in your object manager
are available for querying through GraphQL.  Filtering is provided for
top-level GraphQL types (those types assigned to fields on the query object
type) and for all association collections below that type.

This project uses the latest advancements in the PHP language.
