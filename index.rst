====================

Welcome to the documentation for
`API-Skeletons/doctrine-graphql <https://github.com/API-Skeletons/doctrine-graphql>`_

This repository uses Doctrine metadata to introspect your entities and builds
relationships dynamically covering your entire schema, if you wish, allowing
deep GraphQL queries on your data with a single entry point.
