Events
======

All events are grouped under a common **ApiSkeletons\\Doctrine\\GraphQL\\Event**
object.  In this repository the same event can be called in different places
based on context such as when building an EntityType and when building the
filters for an EntityType; both places need the same type override.  That is
why all events are grouped.


Filtering Query Builders
------------------------

Each top level entity to query uses a QueryBuilder object.  This QueryBuilder
object should be modified to filter the data for the logged in user.  This is
the security layer.  QueryBuilders are built then triggered through an event.
Listen to this event and modify the passed QueryBuilder to apply your security.
The queryBuilder already has the entityClassName assigned to fetch with the
alias 'row'.

.. code-block:: php

    use Laminas\EventManager\Event as LaminasEvent;
    use ZF\Doctrine\GraphQL\Event;

    $events = $container->get('SharedEventManager');

    $events->attach(
        Event::class,
        Event::FILTER_QUERY_BUILDER,
        function(LaminasEvent $event)
        {
            switch ($event->getParam('entityClassName')) {
                case 'Db\Entity\Performance':
                    // Modify the queryBuilder for your needs
                    $event->getParam('queryBuilder')
                        ->andWhere('row.id = 1')
                        ;
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }
        },
        100
    );


Resolve
-------

The **Event::RESOLVE** event includes the **parameters**
and allows you to override the whole ResolveLoader event.  This allows
you to have custom parameters and act on them through the ResolveLoader
RESOLVE event.


Resolve Post
------------

The **Event::RESOLVE_POST** event allows you to modify the values
returned from the ResolveLoader via an ArrayObject or replace the values.


Override GraphQL Type
---------------------

The **Event::MAP_FIELD_TYPE** event allows you to override the GraphQL
type for any field.  Imagine you have an **array** field on an entity and
the array field is multi-dimentional.  Because this module handles arrays
as arrays of strings (because GraphQL needs to know exact subtypes of types)
it cannot handle a multi-dimentional array.  A good solution is to turn the
value into JSON in a hydrator strategy and override the type to a String.

.. code-block:: php

    use Laminas\EventManager\Event as LaminasEvent;
    use GraphQL\Type\Definition\Type;
    use ZF\Doctrine\GraphQL\Event;

    $events = $container->get('SharedEventManager');

    $events->attach(
        Event::class,
        Event::MAP_FIELD_TYPE,
        function(LaminasEvent $event)
        {
            $hydratorAlias = $event->getParam('hydratorAlias');
            $fieldName = $event->getParam('fieldName');

            if ($hydratorAlias == 'ApiSkeletons\\Doctrine\\GraphQL\\Hydrator\\Db_Entity_Artist') {
                if ($fieldName === 'arrayField') {
                    $event->stopPropagation();

                    return Type::string();
                }
            }
        },
        100
    );
