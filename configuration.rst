Schema Configuration
====================


Context
-------

The `Context` object provided enables configuration of GraphQL through the
following options:

* limit - Set a maximum limit of each data section in a query
* hydratorSection - Which section within the hydrator configuration should
  be used
* useHydratorCache - By default all hydrator operations are not cached.
  Enabling this value will cache all the hydrator operation in anticipation
  that the result may be reused later in the same query.

Context is the configuration for each GraphQL entry point.  This allows
unlimited configuration through multiple hydrator sections.

You must use the same context object for a Query as you assign to the Loader.
This may be done via different Schemas or different RPC endpoints.


useHydratorCache Context Option
-------------------------------

The hydrator cache by defaults stores only the most recent hydrator extract
data in anticipation that the next call to the
`FieldResolver <https://github.com/API-Skeletons/doctrine-graphql/blob/master/src/Field/FieldResolver.php>`_
will be the same object and the cache can be used.  If the same object is
not requesed for extraction then the cache is flushed and the new result
is cached.

For a query

.. code-block:: js

    {
      artist ( filter: { id: 2 } ) {
        performance {
          performanceDate
        }
      }
    }


All performance dates for the artist 2 will be returned.  Internally each
performance is extracted according to the hydrator filters and strategies
assigned to the hydrator section and entity.  This may be many more fields
than just performanceDate.  And since we are only interested in one value
setting useHydratorCache to false will flush the cache with each new object
so once a performanceDate is read and the next performance is sent to the
`FieldResolver <https://github.com/API-Skeletons/doctrine-graphql/blob/master/src/Field/FieldResolver.php>`_
the previous hydrator extract data is purged.

For a query

.. code-block:: js

    {
      performance ( filter: { id:1 } ) {
        performanceDate set1 set2 artist {
          name
        }
        set3
      }
    }


useHydratorCache set to true will cause set3 to be pulled from the cache.
If it were set to false set3 would generate a new hydrator extract operation
on an entity which had already been extracted once before.

useHydratorCache set to false will fetch set1 and set2 from the single-entity
cache created by the performanceDate.


Supported Data Types
--------------------

This module would like to support all datatypes representable in a GraphQL
response.  At this time these data types are supported::

    array    - Arrays are handled as arrays of strings because Doctrine
               does not type the values of the array.
    tinyint
    smallint
    integer
    int
    bigint
    boolean
    decimal
    float
    string
    text
    datetime


Dates are handled as ISO 8601 e.g. `2004-02-12T15:19:21+00:00`

If you have need to support a datatype not listed here please create an
issue on the github project.


Provided Tools
--------------

There are three tools this library provides to help you build your
GraphQL Schema.

* **TypeLoader** - This tool creates a GraphQL type for a top-level entity and
  all related entities beneath it.  It also creates resolvers for related
  collections using the
  `api-skeletons/doctrine-criteria <https://github.com/API-Skeletons/doctrine-criteria>`_
  library.
* **FilterLoader** - This tool creates filters for all non-related fields
  (collections) such as strings, integers, etc.  These filters are built from
  the `laminas-api-tools/api-tools-doctrine-querybuilder <https://github.com/laminas-api-tools/api-tools-doctrine-querybuilder>`_
  library.
* **ResolveLoader** - This tool builds the querybuilder object and queries the
  database based on the FilterLoader filters.

Each of these tools takes a fully qualified entity name as a paramter
allowing you to create a top level GraphQL query field for any entity.

There is not a tool for mutations.  Those are left to the developer to build.
