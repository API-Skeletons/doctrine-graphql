====================

Welcome to the documentation for `api-skeletons/zf-doctrine-graphql <https://github.com/API-Skeletons/zf-doctrine-graphql>`_

This repository uses Doctrine metadata to introspect your entities and builds relationships dynamically covering your entire
schema, if you wish, allowing deep GraphQL queries on your data with a single entry point.
