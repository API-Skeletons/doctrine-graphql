GraphiQL and Documentation
==========================

Support for GraphiQL was added in v1.0.5 along with support for introspection queries.

The documentation for each field is created with a DocumentationProvider.  Included
with zf-doctrine-graphql is an ApigilityDocumentationProvider.  If you have need for
another form of documentation provider please create an issue on github.  The more
included providers the merrier.
